### Workflow

***Code Commit***: Developers commit code changes to the version control repository.

***Code Build***: Code changes trigger automated builds using AWS CodeBuild, compiling code and running unit tests.

***Code Review***: Automated code reviews and quality checks are performed.

***Deployment***: Approved changes are automatically deployed to staging environments using AWS CodeDeploy.

***Testing***: Automated tests, including integration and end-to-end tests, are executed in the staging environment.

***Approval***: Manual approval is required before changes are deployed to production.

***Production Deployment***: Approved changes are deployed to the production environment using AWS CodeDeploy.
